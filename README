Text::Balanced::Simple

Text::Balanced::Simple is a Perl module to rival Text::Balanced in order to
provide a slightly more ... modern interface to what is a common task.

It was written to solve the problem of trying to return text in balanced
delimiters regardless of whether it is bracketed or not; which, believe it or
not, is something I wanted to do.

Check out its perldoc for usage information.
